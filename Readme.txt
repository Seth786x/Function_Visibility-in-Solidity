This Solidity programme demonstrates visibility features that manage function and state variable access. It comprises functions that are internal, external, and public, as well as state variables that are private. Private variables are only available within the declaring contract, but public variables are available within the contract, derived contracts, and externally. The contract and its derived contracts guarantee encapsulation within the contract family by granting access to internal functions. In order to optimise gas usage for external interactions, external functions are called from outside the contract. The derived contract shows how to access the base contract's internal variables and functions. This configuration demonstrates the strong access control features of Solidity, which guarantee safe and effective contract design.
